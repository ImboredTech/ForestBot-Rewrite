# Forest Bot

Forest bot is an discord bot written in discord.js with many features including moderation, games, server management and much more.

## What is our purpose?

The purpose of our bot is to eliminate clutter in discord servers. Once you had Forest Bot you will be able to remove every other bot as our bot will have the same features.
